Pro Tips for Learning with Claude
1. Share Code Context
Instead of: "My code doesn't work"
Do this: "Here's my component [paste code]. I'm getting [error]. What am I missing?"
2. Ask for Explanation First
Before building: "Explain useState hook and when to use it"
Then build: "Now help me use useState in my ProductList component"
3. Request Code Review
After building: "Review this component for React best practices"
Learn from feedback, don't just apply changes blindly
4. Progressive Learning
Don't ask: "Build me a complete inventory system"
Do ask: "Help me build one feature at a time, explaining each step"
5. Connect to Your Background
"I understand Java classes. How are React components similar/different?"
"In Swing I used ActionListener. What's the React equivalent?"
6. Save Important Conversations
